This ATM use case diagram shows how customers, technicians, and bank systems interact with the ATM machine.
Customers perform actions like entering a card, authentication, and transactions (withdraw, deposit, transfer, check balance).
Technicians maintain and refill the ATM, while the bank system authorizes and updates transactions.
The ATM use case diagram provides a detailed overview of how various users interact with the automated teller machine (ATM) system and its connection with the bank’s central system.
The customer plays a primary role by performing actions such as inserting the card, entering the PIN, and undergoing authentication before being allowed to carry out different financial transactions. These include cash withdrawal, fund transfer, balance inquiry, and deposit, followed by the option to print a receipt for transaction confirmation.
The technician ensures the ATM remains operational by performing maintenance activities such as refilling cash and servicing the machine when required.
Additionally, the bank system communicates with the ATM to authorize transactions and update account balances in real-time, ensuring accuracy, security, and reliability in all operations.
Another actor, such as a bank administrator or auditor, is responsible for monitoring transactions and generating system reports to maintain transparency and detect any irregularities in the ATM’s functioning.
